      Rise of Magadha Empire<br>(c. 600 BCE)
    </div>

    <p>
      Magadha, ancient kingdom of <a href="#">India</a>, situated in what is now west-central <a href="#">Bihar</a> state, in northeastern India. 
      It was the nucleus of several larger kingdoms or empires between the 6th century BCE and the 8th century CE. 
      The early importance of Magadha may be explained by its strategic position in the 
      <a href="#">Ganges (Ganga) River</a> valley, enabling it to control communication and trade on the river. 
      The river further provided a link between Magadha and the rich ports in the 
      <a href="#">Ganges delta</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Under King <a href="#">Bimbisara</a> (reigned c. 543–c. 491 BCE) of the Haryanka line, the kingdom of Anga (eastern Bihar) was added to Magadha. 
      Kosala was annexed later. The supremacy of Magadha continued under the <a href="#">Nanda</a> (4th century BCE) and 
      <a href="#">Mauryan</a> (4th–2nd century BCE) dynasties; under the Mauryan <a href="#">dynasty</a> the empire included almost the entire subcontinent of India. 
      The early centuries CE saw the decline of Magadha, but the rise of the <a href="#">Gupta dynasty</a> in the 4th century brought it once more to a position of preeminence.
