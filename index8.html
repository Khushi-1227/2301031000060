      Vedic Period (c. 1500–500 BCE)
    </div>
    
    <p>
      The Vedic Period started with the advent of the Aryans in around 1500 BCE, which coincided with the 
      <a href="#">Late Harappan period</a> (associated with the decline of the Indus valley civilization). 
      Aryans spoke Sanskrit, which is considered the origin of most of the current languages of the Indian subcontinent and is 
      said to be a part of Indo-European languages, which is the origin point of most European languages and Persian.
    </p>

    <p>
      Early scholars such as Wheeler believed that the Aryan tribes originally came from the steppes and invaded India around 1500 BCE. 
      This was known as the <a href="#">Aryan Invasion theory</a>. However, we have discussed in the previous article why an Aryan Invasion 
      is an unlikely theory. Therefore, it has been rejected in favour of a much more plausible Aryan Migration theory.
